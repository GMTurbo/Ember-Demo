Ember App made by following along with codeschool.com

I have a REST server written that this connects with, so it won't work without it unless you modify it like so:

App.ApplicationAdapter = DS.FixtureAdapter.extend();

then you uncomment out the following in app.js:

App.Product.FIXTURES = products;
App.Contact.FIXTURES = contacts;
App.Review.FIXTURES = reviews;

k. bye.
